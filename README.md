3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   In the Vercel deployment settings, add this environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
   ```
   Replace `your-railway-app` with your actual Railway app name.

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your dashboard

### Step 2: Update Environment Variable

In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Update `VITE_API_BASE` with your Railway URL
4. Redeploy the project

### Step 3: Verify API Endpoints

Your Railway API should have these endpoints available:
- `GET /api/feeds` - List all feeds
- `POST /api/feeds` - Create new feed
- `DELETE /api/feeds/:id` - Delete feed

   ```

3. **Update .env**
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for Production**
   ```bash

```

### API Connection Issues
1. Verify your Railway API is running
2. Check the `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable
3. Ensure CORS is configured on your Railway API
4. Test API endpoints directly in browser/Postman

### Environment Variable Issues
- Environment variables in Vercel must start with `VITE_`
